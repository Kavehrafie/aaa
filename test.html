        Cecilia Vicu√±a, <i>Disappeared Quipu</i> (2018)
    </h2>
</a>
<p>
    In
    2018, the Chilean artist Cecilia Vicu&ntilde;a installed a work titled&nbsp;<i>Disappeared Quipu</i>&nbsp;in two
    successive exhibitions, the first at the Brooklyn Museum and the second at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. In the
    monumental scale characteristic of her late-career works, 24-foot strands of raw, white wool hang from the ceiling
    and pool heavily on the floor.</p>
